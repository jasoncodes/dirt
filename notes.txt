* logcontrol: flickering when resizing

* inputcontrol: when colour popup shows on GTK (and possibly other
  non-win32s) we seem to not be able to programmically give focus back to
  main window. Presently if an error occurs focusing the main window, the
  popup will be closed so the app is still usable but the popup will be
  unavailable.

* need a portable way open a URL
  ShellExecute works good on Win32, but what about others?

* animations, flickering, etc, happening when minimize, ctrl-tab, etc

* copy w/o formatting, find text, etc

* scroll window when making selection drag

* type -->blah'<--. problem is in ConvertUrlsToLinks

* console client ui for win32
  (and hopefully automaticly linux w/ the help of a virtual x server)
