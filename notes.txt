* ability to search logs. get details from 2003/08/23 log with Blacksage

* senders should sit in the send loop for upto 500 ms
  If longer then break out and fake a "ok to send more" event

* wxBug: bitmap button disabled mask not working (as if we wern't using wx/msw/wx.rc)
  reproduces in unmodified controls sample

* wxBug: each line read with wxTextFile has a null char on the end
  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=309863&aid=789039&group_id=9863

* auto-reconnect if connection lost (due to timeout or kick for example)
  status messages should not be as verbose as existing /reconnect and should
  only say something like "*** Connection restored" after the "*** Connection lost"
  or "*** Ping timeout". make sure no auto-reconnect happens on a /quit

* slow clients freeze when faster clients send to them

* recheck away msg and nicks in PopulateFilteredWords()
  (keep a copy of the nick/away msg before filtering and use it for refiltering)

* UPnP IGD support for socket binds (transfers and server)

* admin feature to change nicks

* admin feature to change away messages

* option to set if sound disabled while /away

* option to auto /back if talk in main window or talk in any window
  ("don't do it if been away for less than x seconds" option too)

* "Show user is typing cue", "Send user is typing cue"

* can't delete dir last sent from / recv to.

* if other side of file transfer is on same subnet as any of local subnets then
  set block size to 8192 KB else 2048 KB

* SOCKS 4/5 BIND support for DCC Listen
  Seems the SOCKS protocol is too restrictive for our needs.
  This probably won't be possible to implement.

* lock for exclusive write any files opened by FileTransfers.cpp
  (make sure reading is still allowed)

* only scroll to bottom if scrollpos was already at or near bottom
  and no scroll in progress and no selection in progress.
  also do red line if no scroll this time (maybe also a sound?)

* /dcc close complete, /dcc close all, /dcc close fail

* /dcc accept all

* Window

* [x] delete file after sent, delete file
  (confirm delete, use win32 recycle bin if available)

* investigate using #if wxUSE_UXTHEME / wxUxThemeEngine wx/msw/uxtheme.h
  for SwitchBar on Windows XP/2003

* nice about screen (wxHtmlWindow maybe?)

* /lock

* /sms with address book in tools menu

* WTS event bindings: Terminal_Connect, Disconnect, Lock, Unlock

* other scriptable bindings: Dirt_AuthPrompt, Connect, Disconnect

* split /lanlist into a UI and model interface and model implementation

* add a server list model implementation for public list (dirt.pl)

* force full line selection if holding control when highlighting in logcontrol

* add kde extension for /resetwindowpos

* speed limiting on file transfers

* update dirt homepage to extract details from exe and show latest ver number and
  modified date (preferably from RCS data, but last modified date would probably
  be okay)

* dirt:// protocol registration for mozilla on X11

* is there a way to tell gethostbyname() to cancel?
  (so we can speed up DNS::Cancel())

* scripting (/exec and /eval)

* create script to generate crypto++ makefiles and change to crypto++ cvs head

* banning (wxIsWild(), wxMatchWild(), wxString::Matches())

* hide /oper password when being typed

* option to ignore colour/bold/etc

* highlighting has bugs on gtk (when updates happen while highlighting)

* when colour popup shows on GTK cannot programmically focus back to main window

* optional password protection for saved passwords and private keys in dirt.ini

* spawn other processes in seperate thread

* notices to users via console@server

* automaticly check for new Win32 builds on dirt.gslabs.com.au

* confirm exit when connected option for client?

* prefix caption with number in brackets showing how many msgs are waiting?

* remove msvcp60.dll (and late msvcrt.dll) dependency (maybe something in Crypto++?)

* research that log control gdi thing in 9x
  seems to be caused by LOTS of wxFont instances
  Perhaps you should if 9x, if messagelog.length > x
  SAY Warning: 9x about to run out of GDI resources
  Win9x Resource Meter uses GetFreeSystemResources (16 bit only)
  maybe the fix will be to use a wxFont cache in wxHTML?

* check that guards are in place where necessary to trap malformed messages

* replace TrayIcon with wxTaskBarIcon and then remove all KDE calls
  (after confirming TaskbarCreated and X11 support exists in 2.4.1)
  (and also after workaround for non-supporting X11 WMs somehow is done in wx)
