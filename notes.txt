* logcontrol: flickering when resizing

* inputcontrol: when colour popup shows on GTK (and possibly other
  non-win32s) we seem to not be able to programmically give focus back to
  main window. Presently if an error occurs focusing the main window, the
  popup will be closed so the app is still usable but the popup will be
  unavailable.

* need a portable way open a URL
  ShellExecute works good on Win32, but what about others?

* flickering when ctrl-tab

* mdi child icon sometimes doesn't show

* copy w/o formatting, find text, etc

* type -->blah'<--. problem is in ConvertUrlsToLinks

* console client ui for win32
  (and hopefully automaticly linux w/ the help of a virtual x server)
  problem 1 is read thread doesnt exit and doesn't get deleted
  (it probably just needs to be "joinable" instead of "detatched")
  problem 2 is that events dispatched from read thread aren't processed
  until the main loop goes (maybe give it an event to cause it to pump?)

* dcc send/recv dialog

* highlight/beep when app isn't focused (ClientUIMDIFrame::AddLine)

* set window pos to bottom of screen, full width
