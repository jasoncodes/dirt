* highlight part of url and mouse pointer should reset back to hand after release

* win32: scrolling, keeping any menu open, resizing/moving window, etc
  stops all network traffic from being processed (seems to be a win32 message pump problem)
  this problem reproduces in the socket sample

* dcc send/recv dialog

* add automated version tab and change dirt homepage to extract details from exe
  and show latest ver number + last update date

* is there a way to tell gethostbyname() to cancel? (so we can speed up DNS::Cancel())

* only scroll to bottom if scrollpos was already at bottom (and/or no sel)?

* scripting (/exec and /eval)

* banning (wxIsWild(), wxMatchWild())

* hide /oper password when being typed

* highlighting has bugs on gtk (when updates happen while highlighting)

* when colour popup shows on GTK cannot programmically focus back to main window

* allow saving of passwords for servers

* optional password protection for saved passwords and private keys in dirt.ini

* /lanlist

* notices to users via console@server

* automaticly check for new versions of Win32 Dirt on dirtchat.sourceforge.net

* hotkey for minimize to tray

* prefix caption with number in brackets showing how many msgs are waiting?

* suppress wxBell when /away?

* research that log control gdi thing in 9x

* non-wrapping lines have row of blank pixels underneath (visible on highlight and bg colour)
