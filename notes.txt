* inputcontrol: when colour popup shows on GTK (and possibly other
  non-win32s) we seem to not be able to programmically give focus back to
  main window. Presently if an error occurs focusing the main window, the
  popup will be closed so the app is still usable but the popup will be
  unavailable.

* flickering when ctrl-tab

* mdi child icon sometimes doesn't show

* hold ctrl for copy w/o formatting, find text via ctrl-f, etc

* dcc send/recv dialog

* only scroll to bottom if scrollpos was already at bottom (and/or no sel)?

* research that log control gdi thing in 9x

* banning, kicking, etc

* single lines (ones that don't wrap) have a line of blank pixels
  underneath the line (visible when highlighting and using background colour)

* highlighting has bugs on gtk (when updates happen while highlighting)

* file transfer firewall note: maybe should try connecting both ways
  at same time, and close the alt route if main succeeds, etc

* prefix caption with number in brackets showing how many msgs are waiting?

* gtk: cannot type into main canvas text box after using nicklist right click menu sometimes

* hide /oper password when being typed

* is there a way to tell gethostbyname() to cancel? (so we can speed up DNS::Cancel())

* dirt:// protocol registration for mozilla on X11

* file transfers
