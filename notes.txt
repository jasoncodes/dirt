* change ctrl/shift/alt detection to use ::GetKeyState() for __WXMSW__ and
  GetCurrentKeyModifiers() for __WXMAC__

* colour codes in the urls (ctrl-k 4 test.com) is highly broke
  in convert to html func

* if a url ends in . or ? then strip it from the url

* don't hyperlink "news:", "http:", etc by themselves

* Automaticly /lock when not focused for X minutes
  min2tray if not already
  tray icon wouldn't flash and would have a lock icon on it
  minimizing would automaticly go to tray
  no auto restore, no bell, no flash tray icon (just red line)
  give 5 second warning before locking (mintotray and then flash lock icon)?

* stop flash after x seconds 3rd icon should be a yellow exclaimation point

* strip formatting chars from nick before checking if valid

* Word Filters: need some way to allow case preservation
  and a way to match whole word only both on a selective
  filter by filter case. also must be easily usable via
  the server console, a GUI would be nice too.

* an option not to match against already replaced words in word filters
  would be nice

* "[Dave TIME reply]: 2003/09/10 11:19:58 UTC-700" should show UTC-0700

* when auto-away after reconnect, need to send away time
  (ticks offset since /away) to keep "away since" correct

* [00:13] *** Looking up 198.142.235.68
  [00:13] *** Connecting to 198.142.235.68
  [00:13] *** Ping timeout

* set default height to say 40% of primary display or 300px (which ever is more)

* set default width as current, but make sure not more that width of primary display

* configfile: access denied on checking last mod,
  "Entry Y appears more than once in Client"
  Is something in ConfigFile not mutex protected?

* do dupe nick check after content enhancing

* win32: only setfocus in timer if GetForegroundWindow is mdi frame

* option to minimize to tray by default (invert ctrl flag)

* only flash 2 times then display maybe a third icon option for system tray

* dirt.pl should not count private ips (192.168.*.*, 172.16.*.* ->
  172.32.*.*, 10.*.*.*) in choosing something for the hostname field

* ability to search logs
	* how load the log search frame?
	* critera at top, listview with matched lines in the middle
	  selecting a matched line shows the log in a preview logcontrol window at bottom
	* keep a cache of the last 10 logs previewed for performance
	* what string to match (wildcard, partial, regex)
	* date range (from/to, before, after, on, last x days/weeks/months)
	* what servers to limit to
	* whether to search server logs or client logs
	* if client logs, list of nicks for queries, all public, all private
	* max hits total, max hits per log
	* log file sort order (cronological or reverse)

* senders should sit in the send loop for upto 500 ms
  If longer then break out and fake a "ok to send more" event

* wxBug: bitmap button disabled mask not working (as if we wern't using wx/msw/wx.rc)
  reproduces in unmodified controls sample

* wxBug: each line read with wxTextFile has a null char on the end
  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=309863&aid=789039&group_id=9863

* auto-reconnect if connection lost (due to timeout or kick for example)
  status messages should not be as verbose as existing /reconnect and should
  only say something like "*** Connection restored" after the "*** Connection lost"
  or "*** Ping timeout". make sure no auto-reconnect happens on a /quit

* slow clients freeze when faster clients send to them

* recheck away msg and nicks in PopulateFilteredWords()
  (keep a copy of the nick/away msg before filtering and use it for refiltering)

* UPnP IGD support for socket binds (transfers and server)

* admin feature to change nicks

* admin feature to change away messages

* option to set if sound disabled while /away

* option to auto /back if talk in main window or talk in any window
  ("don't do it if been away for less than x seconds" option too)

* "Show user is typing cue", "Send user is typing cue"

* can't delete dir last sent from / recv to.

* if other side of file transfer is on same subnet as any of local subnets then
  set block size to 8192 KB else 2048 KB

* SOCKS 4/5 BIND support for DCC Listen
  Seems the SOCKS protocol is too restrictive for our needs.
  This probably won't be possible to implement.

* lock for exclusive write any files opened by FileTransfers.cpp
  (make sure reading is still allowed)

* only scroll to bottom if scrollpos was already at or near bottom
  and no scroll in progress and no selection in progress.
  also do red line if no scroll this time (maybe also a sound?)

* /dcc close complete, /dcc close all, /dcc close fail

* /dcc accept all

* Window
	Close
		Current Ctrl-F4
		Query Windows

* [x] close on complete

* [x] close on remote cancel

* [x] close on fail

* [x] delete file after sent, delete file
  (confirm delete, use win32 recycle bin if available)

* resend (for aborted/failed)

* investigate using #if wxUSE_UXTHEME / wxUxThemeEngine wx/msw/uxtheme.h
  for SwitchBar on Windows XP/2003

* nice about screen (wxHtmlWindow maybe?)

* /lock

* /sms with address book in tools menu

* WTS event bindings: Terminal_Connect, Disconnect, Lock, Unlock

* other scriptable bindings: Dirt_AuthPrompt, Connect, Disconnect

* split /lanlist into a UI and model interface and model implementation

* add a server list model implementation for public list (dirt.pl)

* force full line selection if holding control when highlighting in logcontrol

* add kde extension for /resetwindowpos

* speed limiting on file transfers

* update dirt homepage to extract details from exe and show latest ver number and
  modified date (preferably from RCS data, but last modified date would probably
  be okay)

* dirt:// protocol registration for mozilla on X11

* is there a way to tell gethostbyname() to cancel?
  (so we can speed up DNS::Cancel())

* scripting (/exec and /eval)

* create script to generate crypto++ makefiles and change to crypto++ cvs head

* banning (wxIsWild(), wxMatchWild(), wxString::Matches())

* hide /oper password when being typed

* option to ignore colour/bold/etc

* highlighting has bugs on gtk (when updates happen while highlighting)

* when colour popup shows on GTK cannot programmically focus back to main window

* optional password protection for saved passwords and private keys in dirt.ini

* spawn other processes in seperate thread

* notices to users via console@server

* automaticly check for new Win32 builds on dirt.gslabs.com.au

* confirm exit when connected option for client?

* prefix caption with number in brackets showing how many msgs are waiting?

* remove msvcp60.dll (and late msvcrt.dll) dependency (maybe something in Crypto++?)

* research that log control gdi thing in 9x
  seems to be caused by LOTS of wxFont instances
  Perhaps you should if 9x, if messagelog.length > x
  SAY Warning: 9x about to run out of GDI resources
  Win9x Resource Meter uses GetFreeSystemResources (16 bit only)
  maybe the fix will be to use a wxFont cache in wxHTML?

* check that guards are in place where necessary to trap malformed messages

* replace TrayIcon with wxTaskBarIcon and then remove all KDE calls
  (after confirming TaskbarCreated and X11 support exists in 2.4.1)
  (and also after workaround for non-supporting X11 WMs somehow is done in wx)

* allow users to specify which browser to use in the options dialog.

* Possible GTK 1.2 bug - ctrl+k and ctrl+b do not work properly. Ctrl+k brings up
  no dialog. Ctrl+b does not always print a special character and then a b - when 
  it does not, the missing space causes the cursor to henceforth appear one character
  behind where it should.

* Possible GTK 1.2 bug - taskbar notification does not always work. 
  Behaviour is inconsistent - sometimes the notification will work (an 
  asterisk will appear), sometimes it will not, during the same session.
