* logcontrol: flickering when resizing

* inputcontrol: when colour popup shows on GTK (and possibly other
  non-win32s) we seem to not be able to programmically give focus back to
  main window. Presently if an error occurs focusing the main window, the
  popup will be closed so the app is still usable but the popup will be
  unavailable.

* flickering when ctrl-tab

* mdi child icon sometimes doesn't show

* copy w/o formatting, find text, etc

* dcc send/recv dialog

* only scroll to bottom if scrollpos was already at bottom?

* when u query a user multiple times it minimises or restores

* research that log control gdi thing in 9x

* ideas for server: banning, motd

* type /lizard and it says (Lizard support is not available at this time)

* tooltips for switchbar (maybe nick list too)

* single lines (ones that don't wrap) have a line of blank pixels
  after the line (when highlighting and using background colour)
  inducing wrapping (making window not as wide eliminates the problem)

* highlighting has bugs on gtk (when updates happen while highlighting)

* gtk: focus problem on right click, query (get a beep and no focus to input)
