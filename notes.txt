GTK: hotkey support

GTK2: clipboard seems to be not performing a UTF8 conversion somewhere

at least win32: ctrl key held down detection needs replacing

GTK2: change font dialog does not default to last selected font

GTK2: scroll wheel on log control not working unless over scrollbar

GTK2: underlined text in log control not working

GTK2: input control not font'd

GTK2: TristateConfigPanel does not render correctly

mintotray on non-supporting build should minimize if possible otherwise "Not supported"

prompt when pasting multiple lines

implement digest auth in http.cpp

filename label in filetransferpanel doesnt convert & to &&

default tab to work like it does in bash (dont pick unless not ambiguous, show list of possibles otherwise)

/./././././../././././
/././././././././././././././.

see if possible to not use GTK yet on linux

change KB to KiB

When a message is filtered, it becomes ASCII, breaking all unicode characters. If the word internet is filtered, for instance, and one types: internet café (using the alt-0233 unicode  é), then the second word comes out caf?.

why is there so much latency in ping yet typing text is so fast
this applies to /ping and /whois and titlebar

add an option to terminate process if service stopped or cant start (command
line) and have an additional script file to run dirt with this option
dirt-service but quit if a certain error code is returned (which will be
triggered by sending a custom signal). after this is done, create a simple
init.d style script for dirt with an option in the script to drop priviliges
to a normal user as well as option to specify config file to use.

full support to control service settings from the console such as admin
password, user password, public list, max users, etc.

wallops. unknown commands should possibly just broadcast out to
console@server. use say to force broadcast or a / prefix to force
command.

optional alert sound if certain words are mentioned (i.e. your name)

---------------------------
Dirt Error
---------------------------
can't open file '\sentry\jason\dirtlogs\Client 20031118190259.dirtlog' (error 3: the system cannot find the path specified.)
---------------------------
OK   
---------------------------

public list updates stopped working in gtk ver. i have a feeling it blocked and never
timed out. check that there is a hard timeout on all operations

add size hints for mdi children

[10:24] <Jason[Work]> i guess it's probably the destructor which is delaying
until next idle that doesnt get called because there is heaps of WM_HOTKEY
msgs in the queue still

investigate missing ppp0 ip on dirt server

not restoring maximized state from client/windowstate/maximized on startup

auto complete should work on the last 10 lines of chat msgs from that window as well
as any nicks in use

/connect dirt://public-list/<server name wildcard>
*** Error connecting to dirt://public-list/<server name wildcard>:
Multiple matches found: match1, match2, (5 more)
each match will be clickable
5 more will take you to the site

make down arrow not clear current input row for n00bs

always show ip along with hostname (in whois and also server user listing)

[04:08] *** Error executing: cmd /k wget
[04:08] *** Error executing: "cmd" /k wget

add to ip list the ip the update came from and also the http proxy internal
ip field

a warning if a large ctrl-v is about to happen?

find in /logs, click on another log (without closing find dialog) hit find again
watch death

Some sorta ServerIRC server layer (as well as the existing ServerDefault and
to be made ServerPeer2Peer) to faciliate using an existing IRC server for
secure chat.. probably make it a backend for the p2p server

tab button background not rendering in options on winxp w/ visual themes
disabled

dirt needs a only listen on these ports option for send and recieve
what'll will eventually end up implementing some sorta option to hint
to dirt what good ports to try would be

Pressing Escape should close the ctrl-k popup if open rather than minimizing
selected mdi client

filter various invalid chars from nick after content enhance (, ), space, etc

for enhanced word filter: option not to use filter for nicks, msg, away, etc

option to globally not filter nicks, msg, away, etc

flash taskbar not often work (although do get beep and redline)

add ssl port listen function to dirt servar
(this won't be nessecary when HTTP tunneling is implemented)

What if Dirt was in the middle of a file transfer or not in away mode,
clicking the close button would either bring up a dialog saying
"This will close Dirt while you are chatting to ppl/transferring files are you sure?"
or may should mintotray instead? 

[12:21] <Jason[Work]> (need an auto-resume file from this usar with this name func)
[12:21] <Jason[Work]> (on the right click menu)

switchbar shouldnt render every second pixel background in 8 bit mode
(should be white instead)

Rate limiting and pausing for file transfers

* auto /away after x inactivity

* auto /back on send public message (send /back before send the public message)

strip trailing comma or period from url

look for bottlenecks in titlebar latency meter

option to disable red and beep for a mdi child (for server console)

* bug filename label in transfer panel has _ bug with & (replace with &&)

* andrew on family, connected to leetbox still cant accept file transfers
  is his public ip from family not being sent to me for some reason?
  add some debug feature to log file transfer stuffs to screen?

* white text on black background mode

* --config uses home dir instead of current dir if no path
  log dir created in %home% even though ./dirtlogs

* automatic /away, use mouse pos on a timer and key press in dirtapp to reset tick


--- anything above here hasn't been sorted by priority yet ---


* strip control codes from href before launching

* only ding on incoming transfer, complete and fail

* change ctrl/shift/alt detection to use ::GetKeyState() for __WXMSW__ and
  GetCurrentKeyModifiers() for __WXMAC__

* if a url ends in . or ? then strip it from the url

* don't hyperlink "news:", "http:", etc by themselves

* Automaticly /lock when not focused for X minutes
  min2tray if not already
  tray icon wouldn't flash and would have a lock icon on it
  minimizing would automaticly go to tray
  no auto restore, no bell, no flash tray icon (just red line)
  give 5 second warning before locking (mintotray and then flash lock icon)?

* stop flash after x seconds 3rd icon should be a yellow exclaimation point

* strip formatting chars from nick before checking if valid

* Word Filters: need some way to allow case preservation
  and a way to match whole word only both on a selective
  filter by filter case. also must be easily usable via
  the server console, a GUI would be nice too.

* an option not to match against already replaced words in word filters
  would be nice

* "[Dave TIME reply]: 2003/09/10 11:19:58 UTC-700" should show UTC-0700

* when auto-away after reconnect, need to send away time
  (ticks offset since /away) to keep "away since" correct

* [00:13] *** Looking up 198.142.235.68
  [00:13] *** Connecting to 198.142.235.68
  [00:13] *** Ping timeout

* set default height to say 40% of primary display or 300px (which ever is more)

* set default width as current, but make sure not more that width of primary display

* configfile: access denied on checking last mod,
  "Entry Y appears more than once in Client"
  Is something in ConfigFile not mutex protected?

* do dupe nick check after content enhancing

* win32: only setfocus in timer if GetForegroundWindow is mdi frame

* option to minimize to tray by default (invert ctrl flag)

* only flash 2 times then display maybe a third icon option for system tray

* dirt.pl should not count private ips (192.168.*.*, 172.16.*.* ->
  172.32.*.*, 10.*.*.*) in choosing something for the hostname field

* ability to search logs
	* how load the log search frame?
	* critera at top, listview with matched lines in the middle
	  selecting a matched line shows the log in a preview logcontrol window at bottom
	* keep a cache of the last 10 logs previewed for performance
	* what string to match (wildcard, partial, regex)
	* date range (from/to, before, after, on, last x days/weeks/months)
	* what servers to limit to
	* whether to search server logs or client logs
	* if client logs, list of nicks for queries, all public, all private
	* max hits total, max hits per log
	* log file sort order (cronological or reverse)

* senders should sit in the send loop for upto 500 ms
  If longer then break out and fake a "ok to send more" event

* wxBug: bitmap button disabled mask not working (as if we wern't using wx/msw/wx.rc)
  reproduces in unmodified controls sample

* wxBug: each line read with wxTextFile has a null char on the end
  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=309863&aid=789039&group_id=9863

* auto-reconnect if connection lost (due to timeout or kick for example)
  status messages should not be as verbose as existing /reconnect and should
  only say something like "*** Connection restored" after the "*** Connection lost"
  or "*** Ping timeout". make sure no auto-reconnect happens on a /quit

* slow clients freeze when faster clients send to them

* recheck away msg and nicks in PopulateFilteredWords()
  (keep a copy of the nick/away msg before filtering and use it for refiltering)

* UPnP IGD support for socket binds (transfers and server)

* admin feature to change nicks

* admin feature to change away messages

* option to set if sound disabled while /away

* option to auto /back if talk in main window or talk in any window
  ("don't do it if been away for less than x seconds" option too)

* "Show user is typing cue", "Send user is typing cue"

* can't delete dir last sent from / recv to.

* if other side of file transfer is on same subnet as any of local subnets then
  set block size to 8192 KB else 2048 KB

* SOCKS 4/5 BIND support for DCC Listen
  Seems the SOCKS protocol is too restrictive for our needs.
  This probably won't be possible to implement.

* lock for exclusive write any files opened by FileTransfers.cpp
  (make sure reading is still allowed)

* only scroll to bottom if scrollpos was already at or near bottom
  and no scroll in progress and no selection in progress.
  also do red line if no scroll this time (maybe also a sound?)

* /dcc close complete, /dcc close all, /dcc close fail

* /dcc accept all

* Window

* [x] close on complete

* [x] close on remote cancel

			directory with browse button

* investigate using #if wxUSE_UXTHEME / wxUxThemeEngine wx/msw/uxtheme.h
  for SwitchBar on Windows XP/2003

* nice about screen (wxHtmlWindow maybe?)

* /lock

* /sms with address book in tools menu

* WTS event bindings: Terminal_Connect, Disconnect, Lock, Unlock

* other scriptable bindings: Dirt_AuthPrompt, Connect, Disconnect

* split /lanlist into a UI and model interface and model implementation

* add a server list model implementation for public list (dirt.pl)

* force full line selection if holding control when highlighting in logcontrol

* add kde extension for /resetwindowpos

* speed limiting on file transfers

* update dirt homepage to extract details from exe and show latest ver number and
  modified date (preferably from RCS data, but last modified date would probably
  be okay)

* dirt:// protocol registration for mozilla on X11

* is there a way to tell gethostbyname() to cancel?
  (so we can speed up DNS::Cancel())

* scripting (/exec and /eval)

* create script to generate crypto++ makefiles and change to crypto++ cvs head

* banning (wxIsWild(), wxMatchWild(), wxString::Matches())
  ban list. ban a single ip or computername or nickname or username
  probably via a wildcard in Nick!user@host format.
  /msg Console@Server BAN n00b!* 2hr Stop being a n00b

* hide /oper password when being typed

* option to ignore colour/bold/etc

* highlighting has bugs on gtk (when updates happen while highlighting)

* optional password protection for saved passwords and private keys in dirt.ini

* spawn other processes in seperate thread

* notices to users via console@server

* automaticly check for new Win32 builds on dirt.gslabs.com.au

* confirm exit when connected option for client?

* prefix caption with number in brackets showing how many msgs are waiting?

* remove msvcp60.dll (and late msvcrt.dll) dependency (maybe something in Crypto++?)

* research that log control gdi thing in 9x
  seems to be caused by LOTS of wxFont instances
  Perhaps you should if 9x, if messagelog.length > x
  SAY Warning: 9x about to run out of GDI resources
  Win9x Resource Meter uses GetFreeSystemResources (16 bit only)
  maybe the fix will be to use a wxFont cache in wxHTML?

* check that guards are in place where necessary to trap malformed messages

* replace TrayIcon with wxTaskBarIcon and then remove all KDE calls
  (after confirming TaskbarCreated and X11 support exists in 2.4.1)
  (and also after workaround for non-supporting X11 WMs somehow is done in wx)

* allow users to specify which browser to use in the options dialog.

* Possible GTK 1.2 bug - ctrl+k and ctrl+b do not work properly. Ctrl+k brings up
  no dialog. Ctrl+b does not always print a special character and then a b - when 
  it does not, the missing space causes the cursor to henceforth appear one character
  behind where it should.

* Possible GTK 1.2 bug - taskbar notification does not always work. 
  Behaviour is inconsistent - sometimes the notification will work (an 
  asterisk will appear), sometimes it will not, during the same session.
