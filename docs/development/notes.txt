char events on logpane when no modifiers should blur and resend the char event to inputarea
all non-shortcut keystrokes to LogPane should focus InputArea and forward the keystroke

save/restore frame rect
	persistence needs to support query windows
	use java.util.prefs.Preferences
	http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/synd/2001/10/17/j2se.html
	
Cmd-N should cascade new windows and use current window size

Cmd-` shouldn't include the hidden menu frame
	add a "Cycle Through Windows" Cmd-` option to the Window menu
	write own cycling code using Frame.getFrames() that skips the menu frame

query windows

pressing up and down while entering text should restore buffer

aliases and bindings

keep selection when doing addTextLine
	save start/end position, clear selection, add line, restore start/end position

acceleration when scrolling logpane

trigger windowClosing events on Cmd-Q

/connect seems to take too long to timeout, especially if DNS succeeds but host is unavailable.

modifier sequences should count as a delimiter when doing tab completion
	should share the existing tokenizer code
		pull the tokenizer out of TextModifierParser?

timers

nicklist
	JSplitPane
	pretty rendering
		http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/GUI/jlist/
	context menu
	double click
	preserve selections when indexes change

resizing is slow with lots of text

double click to select word

Cmd-F to search log text

ensure exceptions are handled in Client for console input and server response

clear selection and focus input after Cmd-C in logpane

sometimes focusing the window by clicking the logpane area causes focus to be lost from the input area
a cursor flickers in the input area and then disappears
focusing window clicks seem to click-through when they shouldn't (on the Mac)

resizing window thinner does not keep scroll bar at bottom if text rewraps

DND and away could deny/allow bounces/Growl via regex or javascript function

clipboard workaround for applet
	cmd-c should show a dialog that can be copied from
	cmd-v should show a blank dialog to paste into
	can this be activated via SecurityException detection? (try reading the clipboard in a key hook)

is it possible to use a drawer on the Mac to display the nicklist?
	http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/JSheets/index.html gives hope

key/value pair status message protocol enhancement. possible uses include:
	current track (iTunes on Mac, Winamp on Windows)
		osascript -e "tell app \"iTunes\" to artist of current track as string & \"\n\" & name of current track as string"
		com.apple.iTunes.playerInfo notification
			http://schinckel.net/2005/06/05/notification-from-applescript-studio/
			can we use NSDistributedNotificationCenter addObserver from Java?
	is typing
	GPS coordinates

LogPane test face has rendering issues. Probably need some nice way to handle line and box drawing characters but I can't think of any nice way to do it right now.

Spellcheck on at least Mac
	Google JavaSpellingFramework.sit

inputarea needs colour popup on Cmd-K

inputarea doesn't preserve buffer if one presses up then down.

keyboard support for scrolling logpane (pgup/down in inputarea)

indented wrapping of long lines
	http://groups.google.com.au/group/comp.lang.java.gui/browse_thread/thread/db1d177fe760cb77

detection of sleep on at least mac and win32

auto-reconnect on resume from sleep && network available

tab indentation in LogPane could be better

/run ssh outpost
	Mac: Open new Terminal window and execute command
	Linux: Can we detect Gnome/KDE and launch their preferred else xterm?
	Win32: Prefer PuttyCYG then Cygwin using csrss (then possibly cmd.exe)

show IP in /whois

away mode support
	/dnd Working
	/brb 30 Dinner

next major protocol change will include:
	magic number and protocol version number (major, minor)
	support for different crypto algorithms
	capabilities listing
	virtual hosting
	compatible with HTTP on the same port.. somehow :)
		can we support a proxy CGI?
		should the request start out looking like HTTP?
	compatible with old clients connecting to the same port
		since it will be HTTP compat, server will wait for
		00 a4 00 00 00 00 30 81 or new protocol HELO msg
		before sending anything

MOTD from server using INFO packets
