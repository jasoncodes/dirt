acceleration when scrolling logpane

if text is outputted when not scrolled to bottom we should have some visual indication
	overlay a grey arrow pointing down on the bottom right of the view?

save/restore frame rect
	use java.util.prefs.Preferences

keep selection when doing addTextLine

nicklist
	JSplitPane
	pretty rendering

	context menu
	double click
	preserve selections when indexes change

resizing is slow with lots of text

double click to select word

Cmd-F to search log text

ensure exceptions are handled in Client for console input and server response

clear selection and focus input after Cmd-C in logpane

sometimes focusing the window by clicking the logpane area causes focus to be lost from the input area
a cursor flickers in the input area and then disappears
focusing window clicks seem to click-through when they shouldn't (on the Mac)

resizing window thinner does not keep scroll bar at bottom if text rewraps

is it possible to use a drawer on the Mac to display the nicklist?

inputarea needs colour popup on Cmd-K

keyboard support for scrolling logpane (pgup/down in inputarea)

bold doesn't work with Monaco. Maybe we could use http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/ or similar instead?

monospace font preference not working on Windows
