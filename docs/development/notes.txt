resizing is slow with lots of text

clear selection and focus input after Cmd-C

ensure all focusing of input controls work with password field too (abstract it)

nicklist
	JSplitPane
	pretty rendering
		http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/GUI/jlist/
	context menu
	preserve selections when indexes change

keep selection when doing addTextLine

shouldn't alert on own messages

acceleration when scrolling logpane

ensure exceptions are handled in Client for console input and server response

signed on at display is 10 hours slow on outpost, 10 hours fast on jasonbookpro
	definitely a server bug (should be outputting unix time)
	probably the ToGMT() call on Server.cpp:1212

tab completion in both Swing and curses interfaces

resizing window thinner does not keep scroll bar at bottom if text rewraps

get max modified date from all .java files in src/ and use that in version string instead of jar date (UTC)

if text is outputted when not scrolled to bottom we should have some visual indication
	overlay a grey arrow pointing down on the bottom right of the view?
