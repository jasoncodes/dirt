window positions should be stored relative to the display's origin along with a display identifier
when restoring window positions, if the display doesn't exist, use the primary display.
use UIUtil.getDefaultScreenID and UIUtil.getScreenBounds in get/setPanelBounds
non-Mac probably also doesn't play nice with zoomed state (and maybe minimized). need some testing

preference to not show a window at startup and/or on dock click

CTCP
	/ping does /ctcp ping
	some interface to allow CTCP hooks
		to be used to implement PING, TIME and in the future DCC
	implement PING
	implement TIME

acceleration when scrolling logpane

move pos/size persistence into a helper class which monitors the component for changes or dispose

	if was sleeping show a reconnect prompt (sheet?) on resume

logging
	Log writer API
	Log reader API
	if logging enabled and FileUtil.getAppDataDir() != null, write logs to new File(FileUtil.getAppDataDir(), "Logs")
	add logging to JFC client
	Log viewer frame
	file associations
	Spotlight plugin

File, Connect dialog
	Nickname
	Hostname
	[Connect]

Spellcheck on at least Mac
	Google JavaSpellingFramework.sit and NSSpellChecker

dirt+https_connect://spawncamp.net/localhost:11626
	setup a test proxy that requires auth, preferably on localhost
	optionally connect to proxy to connect to remote on port 443 (HTTPConnectProxy?)
		is there any way we can use the browser's settings (incl. auth) when in an applet?
		see if HttpURLConnection does http auth for us or not. if so, see how it does it. (java.net.Authenticator?)
			Google results suggests HttpURLConnection will. However, if we can't do the same ourselves, this is a show stopper.
			security settings may prevent opening a Socket to the proxy directly, also a possibly show stopper
	once connected to remote, setup SSL using SSLSocket
	use HTTPConnectProxy again to connect to localhost:11626

Cmd-F to search log text

Copying blocks of text without "[hh:mm] <Nick> "
	Cmd-Shift-C?
	Context menu
	Selection to should be automatically expanded to whole lines (and restored after copy)

file transfers
	NAT traversal
		Investigate jstunt <http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/p2prg/current/msg00789.html>
	

trigger windowClosing events via mnuQuit
	/exit should do the same (after sending a /quit "$@")

alias, bind, timers
	do we really need these? (expecially 3.0 compatibility?)
		should we just wait and implement scripting instead?

keep selection when doing addTextLine
	save start/end position, clear selection, add line, restore start/end position

Window Menu
	Bring all to front (test on all platforms, okay to be Mac only if too hard)
	Window List. Ideally with diamond for minimized windows
	sweethome3d.sf.net has code that does both these

log reader/writer API
	SQL db stores raw message data with search keywords after processing (i.e. regexes)

nicklist
	pretty rendering
		http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/GUI/jlist/
	context menu
	double click
	status icons
	preserve selections when indexes change

font selection
	- Monaco (Mac only, requires fake bold)
	- DejaVu Sans Mono
	- Bitstream Vera Sans Mono
	- Lucida Sans Typewriter

translucency options
	UIUtil.setFrameAlpha
		X11 code confirmed
		Win32 code has redraw issues under Parallels Coherence
	change based on focus
	per window setting

pretty <blockquote />
	support for multiline message rendering
	should it trigger for all multiline pastes? (and act as a safety for flooding)
	ability to drag or paste text from browser and have it render as <blockquote/> with cite and title
		at worst use a dialog to paste meta data into
	pretty renderer for <blockquote/>
	how will DirtML messages work?
		need some OOB method of flagging these messages
			maybe a preamble of some sort. null delims isn't possible for flags

/connect seems to take too long to timeout, especially if DNS succeeds but host is unavailable.

modifier sequences should count as a delimiter when doing tab completion
	should share the existing tokenizer code
		pull the tokenizer out of TextModifierParser?

resizing is slow with lots of text

double click to select word

ensure exceptions are handled in Client for console input and server response

resizing window thinner does not keep scroll bar at bottom if text rewraps

DND and away could deny/allow bounces/Growl via regex or javascript function

clipboard workaround for applet
	cmd-c should show a dialog that can be copied from
	cmd-v should show a blank dialog to paste into
	can this be activated via SecurityException detection? (try reading the clipboard in a key hook)

is it possible to use a drawer on the Mac to display the nicklist?
	http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/JSheets/index.html gives hope

key/value pair status message protocol enhancement. possible uses include:
	current track (iTunes on Mac, Winamp on Windows)
		osascript -e "tell app \"iTunes\" to artist of current track as string & \"\n\" & name of current track as string"
		com.apple.iTunes.playerInfo notification
			http://schinckel.net/2005/06/05/notification-from-applescript-studio/
			can we use NSDistributedNotificationCenter addObserver from Java?
	is typing
	GPS coordinates

LogPane test face has rendering issues. Probably need some nice way to handle line and box drawing characters but I can't think of any nice way to do it right now.

512px icon for Mac OS X

inputarea needs colour popup on Cmd-K

inputarea doesn't preserve buffer if one presses up then down.

keyboard support for scrolling logpane (pgup/down in inputarea)

indented wrapping of long lines
	http://groups.google.com.au/group/comp.lang.java.gui/browse_thread/thread/db1d177fe760cb77

auto-reconnect on resume from sleep && network available

tab indentation in LogPane could be better

/run ssh outpost
	Mac: Open new Terminal window and execute command
	Linux: search path for x-terminal-emulator then lxterm then xterm
	Win32: Prefer PuttyCYG then Cygwin using csrss (then possibly cmd.exe)

show IP in /whois

away mode support
	/dnd Working
	/brb 30 Dinner

next major protocol change will include:
	magic number and protocol version number (major, minor)
	support for different crypto algorithms
	capabilities listing
	virtual hosting
	compatible with HTTP on the same port.. somehow :)
		can we support a proxy CGI?
		should the request start out looking like HTTP?
	compatible with old clients connecting to the same port
		since it will be HTTP compat, server will wait for
		00 a4 00 00 00 00 30 81 or new protocol HELO msg
		before sending anything

	documentFile client property makes a draggable and cmd-clickable file proxy icon
	how do we make a non-clickable one like Adium?

CLDC/MIDP (J2ME)
	Random Thoughts
		Copy MPP sample into a working dir
		Get it running on an emulator and actual device
		Get generics working in test code
		Get HTML renderer working in test code
			Needs append support
			Needs to be able to reasonably parse TextModifierParser output
		Add some test socket code
		Add some test crypto code
		Exclude J2SE specific code
			Can we easily do this without a second source tree?
			Probably have exclusions of j2se/jfc/cli dirs for CLDC
			Exclude cldc dirs in j2se build
		Factory classes will need new getInstance/newInstance methods
			pull getInstance code into platform (j2se/cldc) specific helper class
				empty stub which throws an exception
				platform version which is copied to correct name post javac
		Customise sample build.xml and integrate into main build.xml
			Use fileset/pattern set to isolate CLDC code from main build
			this will need to be very selective about what .java files to pull over to a
				temp src dir in build/. Separate build dir will locate dependancy issues.
