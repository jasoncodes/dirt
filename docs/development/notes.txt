sockets in J2SE and J2ME are going to be implemented using threads for client side
and probably nio server side. This means the core crypt socket system needs to be abstract and work with buffers. there's an SSL library in maybe 1.5 or 1.6 that uses this paradigm.

Our socket API will invoke callbacks when interesting things happen. All of J2SE, nio and J2ME implementations will implement this API. The crypt socket will wrap the base socket instance and provide transparent encryption and a message (rather than stream) based interface like the 3.0 CryptSocket.
