MRJAdapter for JFC client UI

query windows

aliases and bindings

acceleration when scrolling logpane

keep selection when doing addTextLine
	save start/end position, clear selection, add line, restore start/end position

nicklist
	JSplitPane
	pretty rendering
		http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/GUI/jlist/
	context menu
	double click
	preserve selections when indexes change

resizing is slow with lots of text

double click to select word

Cmd-F to search log text

ensure exceptions are handled in Client for console input and server response

clear selection and focus input after Cmd-C in logpane

sometimes focusing the window by clicking the logpane area causes focus to be lost from the input area
a cursor flickers in the input area and then disappears
focusing window clicks seem to click-through when they shouldn't (on the Mac)

resizing window thinner does not keep scroll bar at bottom if text rewraps

is it possible to use a drawer on the Mac to display the nicklist?
	http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/JSheets/index.html gives hope

show a confirmation pane when closing a MainFrame with an option to set the quit message

key/value pair status message protocol enhancement. possible uses include:
	current track (iTunes on Mac, Winamp on Windows)
	is typing
	GPS coordinates

LogPane test face has rendering issues. Probably need some nice way to handle line and box drawing characters but I can't think of any nice way to do it right now.
