update Contact to have protected fields

split ConsoleCommand and processConsoleInput into a different class
that has no internal access to the Client object

resizing is slow with lots of text

double click to select word

Cmd-F to search log text

clear selection and focus input after Cmd-C

ensure all focusing of input controls work with password field too (abstract it)

nicklist
	JSplitPane
	pretty rendering
		http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/GUI/jlist/
	context menu
	double click
	preserve selections when indexes change

keep selection when doing addTextLine

shouldn't alert on own messages and away statuses

acceleration when scrolling logpane

ensure exceptions are handled in Client for console input and server response

signed on at display is 10 hours slow on outpost, 10 hours fast on jasonbookpro
	definitely a server bug (should be outputting unix time)
	probably the ToGMT() call on Server.cpp:1212

tab completion in both Swing and curses interfaces

sometimes focusing the window by clicking the logpane area causes focus to be lost from the input area
a cursor flickers in the input area and then disappears
focusing window clicks seem to click-through when they shouldn't (on the Mac)

resizing window thinner does not keep scroll bar at bottom if text rewraps

get max modified date from all .java files in src/ and use that in version string instead of jar date (UTC)

if text is outputted when not scrolled to bottom we should have some visual indication
	overlay a grey arrow pointing down on the bottom right of the view?

inputarea needs colour popup on Cmd-K

keyboard support for scrolling logpane (pgup/down in inputarea)

monospace font preference not working on Windows

indented wrapping of long lines
